Every message, every call, every shared memory since then has been a testament to how that one click changed everything.",

      "“He was the dream; she was the dreamer.” And so, a wandering jihadi knight and a lovely princess spent countless nights together in a world made only for them—rich, fanciful, and alive with wonder. You might find them in the castle, cooking side by side, or running through open meadows, or beneath the tree where they carved their names. Sometimes they fought demons; other times, they simply sat there and enjoyed looking at eachother's eyes. What mattered was never where they were or what they faced—only that they were together, and that they were happy."

I sent her a message and waited, expecting her reply the way one expects sunrise. Minutes passed. Then hours. Silence stretched, heavy and unfamiliar.\nI sat there with my phone clenched in my hand, as if it were a lifeline. Each passing minute felt like something slipping away. The screen stayed empty, and time itself began to haunt me—every second turning into a ghost of what should have been.\nI searched desperately for proof that she was okay. Anyone. Anything. I crossed lines I never thought I would, using methods I shouldn’t have, because accepting the alternative was impossible. I couldn’t believe that someone who had become my whole world could simply disappear from it.\nAnd there I was, surrounded by everything I owned, realizing that my entire world had shattered into silence."
